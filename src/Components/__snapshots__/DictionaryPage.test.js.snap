You would have successfully forced them to throw a backhand which is huge when it comes to plays and strategy. Forcing flick would be stopping the opposing thrower from throwing a backhand. As you can see in the picture to the right the thrower is being forced to flick it. He has a wide open flick but it will be very challenging to backhand.
