# ü•è UltimateApp - Disc In

Developing an app to enhance Ultimate coaching abilities

## ‚å®Ô∏è Development

```
git clone git@github.com:disc-in/UltimateApp.git
cd UltimateApp
npm install -g expo-cli
npm install
npm run start
```

## üëè Contributing

If you want to contribute to the projet, just pick up an issue from the [list](https://github.com/disc-in/UltimateApp/issues) and start fixing it. You can then open a pull-request so that your contribution can be merged into the master branch.

Found a bug? Take 5 minutes to [report it](https://github.com/disc-in/UltimateApp/issues/new?assignees=&labels=bug&template=bug_report.md&title=)

Not a developer? We always need people to help us with:
* improving the **wording** of the application, drills, training programs, to make it easier to understand;
* drawing the **animations** of the drills in the app;
* **testing** the app;
* **gathering feedback** from our users;
* **processing the feedbacks** we get to decide which features should be implemented;

Feel free to contact us on [facebook](https://www.facebook.com/DiscInApp) or by email (ultimate.discin_at_gmail.com) to discuss it.

### Tests

We expect every code introduced via a pull-request to be tested.
We use [jest](https://jestjs.io/docs/en/tutorial-react-native) and [React Native Testing Library](https://callstack.github.io/react-native-testing-library/) as testing frameworks. Please refer to the documentation, look at [existing tests](https://github.com/disc-in/UltimateApp/blob/master/src/Components/DrillListPage.test.js) or ask questions if needed.

### Mock http records

We use [nock](https://github.com/nock/nock) to mock HTTP calls. Have look at an example [here](https://github.com/disc-in/UltimateApp/blob/master/src/Components/shared/VimeoVideo.test.js).

To get the expected return from Nock, you can run your tests without mocking and record the http calls. The documentation is [there](https://github.com/nock/nock#recording).

## Release

To release a new version of the app :
1. Send a pull request updating the version in `app.json`, as well as buildNumber (ios) and versionCode (android)
2. When it is merged, create a release on Github
3. `expo publish --release-channel staging`
4. If needed, republish to the stores
