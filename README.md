Developing an app to enhance Ultimate coaching abilities

## ‚å®Ô∏è Development

## üëè Contributing

If you want to contribute to the projet, just pick up a free issue from the [list](https://github.com/UltimateApp/UltimateApp/issues) and start developing. You can then open a pull-request so that your contribution can be merged into the master branch.

Found a bug? Take 5 minutes to [report it](https://github.com/UltimateApp/UltimateApp/issues/new?assignees=&labels=bug&template=bug_report.md&title=)

### Tests

We expect every code introduced via a pull-request to be tested.
We use [jest](https://jestjs.io/docs/en/tutorial-react-native) and [react-native-testing-library](https://callstack.github.io/react-native-testing-library/) as testing frameworks. Please refer to the documentation, look at [existing tests](https://github.com/UltimateApp/UltimateApp/blob/master/src/Components/DrillListPage.test.js) or ask questions if needed.

### Mock http records

We use [nock](https://github.com/nock/nock) to mock HTTP calls. Have look at an example [here](https://github.com/UltimateApp/UltimateApp/blob/master/src/Components/VimeoVideo.test.js).

To get the expected return from Nock, you can run your tests without mocking and record the http calls. The documentation is [there](https://github.com/nock/nock#recording).

### üÜò Help!

And feel free to ask questions!
